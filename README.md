boot-py
=======
I wanted to make a new CMS for experimenting purpose its still in its very early stages.
where it manages to spurt out bootstrap embedded html code.It currently has some modules such as for paragraph and navigation etc.
But for now i plan to add more such modules and think about editing the code when i have integrated most of the bootstrap in it.
i plan it to be a complete CMS written in purely 2.7 python first of its kind at least i havent found anything like it.
i would like help from the community to help me make this a possibility i wanted to provide a more refined version,
but this is all i have right now.
I plan on improving it in CLI first and if we manage to get that to a advanced stage then i will think of converting it into a GUI
,also i havent shared or talked to many people about this project so i dont know if i have taken the right approach,
but i suppose you guys can help me out.
