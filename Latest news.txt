[LATEST]major part of code has been re wrote from scratch it has fixed alot of bugs still some bugs presists though but the approach is correct its
just that the code needs more cleaning SEE YA NEXT TIME




#Hi i am currently working on fixing existing bugs and i will fix indentation after that i will start working on the blogging
CMS i have decided that it will be branch which will be dedicated to bloging only and i will keep working on this as
a regular site generator Cheers :D

LATEST WAZZUP:
A minor bug caught while saving it will be fixed [DONE]
along with the version in which i will introduce basic editing [Will elaborate it later] [Still working on it]                                   
Start working on the option to edit code as well as adding new things to files created through previous sessions/executions[Still working on it]   




I am starting to see the limitation of CLI so while i am working on the code , i ve started looking into GUI
 i havent decided to release it as a webapp like in browser similar to wordpress or proper windows software i will reflect on it in the meanwhile

i am currently working on a major release where i will be using a more refined version of this program i am thinking
of using it as a cms for blogs so from now i will update the program accordingly i will place the current program in legacy
folder so you can check it out i might update it as well sorry for the hiatus , i had exams, but i am working on 
the program every spare moment i get.

Sarim Zafar
