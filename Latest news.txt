#Hi i am currently working on fixing existing bugs and i will fix indentation after that i will start working on the blogging
CMS i have decided that it will be branch which will be dedicated to bloging only and i will keep working on this as
a regular site generator Cheers :D


Blogging feature is on hold i am currently trying to get in some more features 


I am starting to see the limitation of CLI so while i am working on the code , i ve started looking into GUI
 i havent decided to release it as a webapp like in browser similar to wordpress or proper windows software i will reflect on it in the meanwhile

i am currently working on a major release where i will be using a more refined version of this program i am thinking
of using it as a cms for blogs so from now i will update the program accordingly i will place the current program in legacy
folder so you can check it out i might update it as well sorry for the hiatus , i had exams, but i am working on 
the program every sparemoment i get.
Regards,
Sarim Zafar
