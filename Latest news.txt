#Hi i am currently working on fixing existing bugs and i will fix indentation after that i will start working on the blogging
CMS i have decided that it will be branch which will be dedicated to bloging only and i will keep working on this as
a regular site generator Cheers :D

LATEST WAZZUP:
Start working on the option to edit code as well as adding new things to files created through previous sessions/executions
Notes to self: add the toggle button in sidebar navigation in upcoming releases as soon as possible[In next release][Still working on its placement]
[DONE]Also add the footer feature in the stable version instead of test one also try to add as many social media hubs as possible[Adding more social media icons]

Blogging feature is on hold i am currently trying to get in some more features 


I am starting to see the limitation of CLI so while i am working on the code , i ve started looking into GUI
 i havent decided to release it as a webapp like in browser similar to wordpress or proper windows software i will reflect on it in the meanwhile

i am currently working on a major release where i will be using a more refined version of this program i am thinking
of using it as a cms for blogs so from now i will update the program accordingly i will place the current program in legacy
folder so you can check it out i might update it as well sorry for the hiatus , i had exams, but i am working on 
the program every spare moment i get.
Regards,
Sarim Zafar
