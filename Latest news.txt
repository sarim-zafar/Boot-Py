#Hi i am currently working on fixing existing bugs and i will fix indentation after that i will start working on the blogging
CMS i have decided that it will be branch which will be dedicated to bloging only and i will keep working on this as
a regular site generator Cheers :D

 i will introduce basic editing such as editing a file you created in before and now want to edit it yeah cool stuff but challenging as well 
though hardly an obstacle Start working on the option to edit code as well as adding new things to files created through previous 
sessions/executions[Still working on it]  

 This to become full fledged Soon enough i hope within two years [Still working on it]                                   


I am starting to see the limitation of CLI so while i am working on the code , i ve started looking into GUI
 i havent decided to release it as a webapp like in browser similar to wordpress or proper windows software i will reflect on it in the meanwhile

i am currently working on a major release where i will be using a more refined version of this program i am thinking
of using it as a cms for blogs so from now i will update the program accordingly i will place the current program in legacy
folder so you can check it out i might update it as well sorry for the hiatus , i had exams, but i am working on 
the program every spare moment i get.

Sarim Zafar
