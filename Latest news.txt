[LATEST]Reworking major part of code will update in a day or two


#Hi i am currently working on fixing existing bugs and i will fix indentation after that i will start working on the blogging
CMS i have decided that it will be branch which will be dedicated to bloging only and i will keep working on this as
a regular site generator Cheers :D

LATEST WAZZUP:
A minor bug caught while saving it will be fixed along with the version in which i will introduce basic editing [Will elaborate it later]                                    
Start working on the option to edit code as well as adding new things to files created through previous sessions/executions[working]



I am starting to see the limitation of CLI so while i am working on the code , i ve started looking into GUI
 i havent decided to release it as a webapp like in browser similar to wordpress or proper windows software i will reflect on it in the meanwhile

i am currently working on a major release where i will be using a more refined version of this program i am thinking
of using it as a cms for blogs so from now i will update the program accordingly i will place the current program in legacy
folder so you can check it out i might update it as well sorry for the hiatus , i had exams, but i am working on 
the program every spare moment i get.
Regards,
Sarim Zafar
